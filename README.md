# Python Projects

This repo contains, as the name itself, some Python Projects. The repo was design originally for me to study and practice. But who knows... 

I pretend to update each project with new stuff that I learn along the way. 

I'll keep a list of every project with a brief sumary of what it can do an etc. 



## Projects!
- Quiz game

It's a interactive quiz game. The idea is that the user will be able to select between themes and even difficulty of the questions. For now it will be on the terminal, but the goal is to make an interface to make it more interactive. 

- Guess the number

It's kind of another interactive game as well... The user set a range for the computer to generate a random number, and then the user guess what number the computer generated. For now its as simple as that, but also will have more advanced funcionalities in the future such as counting the tries and sort of a scoreboard type of thing.
